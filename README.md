# Lets Go Places

## Project Story
Traveling has the potential to be exceptionally fulfilling. It exposes you to new cultures, different perspectives, and unique experiences.  The more you travel the more you see the world around you, and the more you learn about yourself. By having a Travel Journal, you can keep all these experiences in one place where you can always re-live and reflect on them. Let’s Go Places is an online journal you can write about trips you have taken. It is a collection of adventures, stories, memories, and discoveries. 
No matter where you are or who you're with Let’s Go Places is right there with you.
